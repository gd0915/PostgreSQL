SELECT * FROM words;

--Select the words whose first character is 's' or 'a' or 'y'
--(*) is optional to use after '^[say]'
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(word, '^[say]');--[] means we have multiple options for the required characters

--Select words whose last character is 'm' or 'a' or 'f'
SELECT word
FROM words 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE (word, '[maf]$');

--Select words whose first character is s and last character 'a'
--1st Way:
SELECT word
FROM words 
WHERE word LIKE 's%a';

--2nd Way:
SELECT word
FROM words 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(word, '^[s].*[a]$');-- '*' means there may be zero or multiple characters 
									  -- '.' means there may be 1 single character(it may be any character)


--Select words which have 'a' in any position
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(word, 'a');-- 'a' is same with '%a%' with LIKE


--Select the words which have characters from 'd' to 't' at the beginning followed by any character then 'l'
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE (word, '^[d-t].[l]');


--Select the words which have characters from 'd' to 't' at the beginning followed by any 2 characters and then  'e'
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE (word, '^[d-t]..[e]');-- '..' ==> 2 undefined any characters 


--Select the words which do not have 'h' in any position.
--NOT LIKE Condition 
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE word NOT LIKE '%h%';

--Select words which do not end with 't' and which do not end with 'f'
--1.Way
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE word NOT LIKE '%t' AND word NOT LIKE '%f';

--2.Way
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE (word, '[tf]$');

--3.Way 
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE word ~ '[^tf]$';

--Select words which start with any character, not followed by 'a', not followed by 'e'
SELECT word
FROM words
WHERE word NOT LIKE '_a%' AND word NOT LIKE '_e%';


--ORDER BY Function: To put the records in ascending or descending order we use ORDER BY
--ORDER BY statement can be used with SELECT clauses

--Put the records in ascending order by using number_of_letters 
SELECT * FROM words 
ORDER BY number_of_letters ASC;--ASC statement is optional here 
							   --because it is returning us default order (natural order \ numeric data => ASC)
							   --but if the task requires DESC order then put DESC explicitly 


--Put the records in descending order 

SELECT *
FROM words
ORDER BY word DESC; --DESC is not optional, if you do not type DESC, the output will be in ascending 


--Note: In ORDER BY, instead off field names, we can use field numbers as well.

SELECT *
FROM words
ORDER BY 3 ASC;--3 stands for number_of_letters column

--SELECT all the data from words table and then ORDER BY second column in DESC order 

SELECT *
FROM words 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

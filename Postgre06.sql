--UNION ALL :Does the same with UNION operator, just it returns repeated records if there is 
--Find the state whose salary is greater than 3000, employee names whose salary less than 2000 with duplication 

SELECT state AS "State or Employee Name", salary 
FROM workers
WHERE salary>3000

UNION ALL

SELECT name AS "State or Employee Name", salary 
FROM workers 
WHERE salary < 2000; 


--INTERSECT operator: 1)Returns the common records of two queries 
--					  2)It returns just the unique data 	

--Find all common employee names whose salary is greater than 2000 and company name is IBM, or APPLE, or MICROSOFT

SELECT name
FROM workers
WHERE salary >2000

INTERSECT 

SELECT name
FROM workers
WHERE company IN('IBM', 'APPLE', 'MICROSOFT');


--EXCEPT (MINUS) Operator: It returns the uncommon data from query1 and from query2.

--Find the employee names whose salary is less than 3000 and not working in Google
--NOT condition is coming from the EXCEPT operator

SELECT name 
FROM workers 
WHERE salary <3000

EXCEPT

SELECT name 
FROM workers 
WHERE company = 'GOOGLE';  


--JOINS 
--1) INNER JOIN: Returns the common data from 2 tables 
--2) LEFT JOIN: Returns the data from the first table 
--3) RIGHT JOIN: Returns the data from the second table
--4) FULL JOIN: Returns the data from both tables 
--5) SELF JOIN: You will have a single table but you will use it as if 2 tables.


--INNER JOIN: 
--Select company name, order id, order date for common companies
SELECT mc.company_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM my_companies mc INNER JOIN orders o
ON o.company_id = mc.company_id;


--LEFT JOIN:
--Get the order id and order date for the companies in my_companies table
SELECT mc.company_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM my_companies mc LEFT JOIN orders o 
ON o.company_id = mc.company_id;


--RIGHT JOIN:
--Get the order id and order date for the companies in orders table 
SELECT mc.company_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM my_companies mc RIGHT JOIN orders o 
ON o.company_id = mc.company_id;

--FULL JOIN 
----Get the order id and order date for every company
SELECT mc.company_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM my_companies mc FULL JOIN orders o 
ON o.company_id = mc.company_id;

--EXAMPLE ANSWER: There are 5 types of Joins. If we have two tables, and we want to get data from the first table and the common 
--data from the second table we use LEFT JOIN.
